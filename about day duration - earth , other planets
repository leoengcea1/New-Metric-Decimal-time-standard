Also note that dividing the day in 24 hours doesn't make sense for any other planet except for earth  because it means the rotation of the planet in its axis(solar day) . and this time is different for every planet. Just counting it in seconds and showing in metric  hours and minutes make more sense

Even for mars that have a very similar day it would not make sense to divide the day in 24 h of 60m of 60s ,see this article:
https://www.whiteclouds.com/faq/how-long-is-a-day-on-mars/
“ Martian clocks would still have 24 hours, but each hour would be divided into slightly longer minutes and seconds than their Earth counterparts.  This results in a Martian second being about 1.027 Earth seconds long.”

Soo changing the measure of second.. Why ? this would be pure idiocy . so you build a car for mars and then the speed would need to be calculated using another base for the second so the units and measures would all be different. Or the batteries , the power in Watt , energy in watt/s this would all change and think about making whole new units for each planet .
Now u go to jupiter with a day about 9 hours(per the other article here) now u need to calculate again and have all the other units on the S.I. remade and again other sets for any other planet in the universe. 
So, forget it . it doesn't make sense. The base unit of the measure of the second doesnt need to change , never. it ‘s already a defined value and based on the decay of some atoms. 
	More on that https://www.bipm.org/en/si-base-units/second. : 
What can change is the usual quantities used to be metrical/decimal like the other SI units and as this proposal .
